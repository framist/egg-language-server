% An \egraph efficiently represents

% Although they were originally developed in the late 1970s
%   for use in automated theorem provers,
%   a more recent technique known as \textit{equality saturation}
%   repurposes \egraphs to implement state-of-the-art,
%   rewrite-driven compiler optimizations and program synthesizers.
% However, \egraphs remain unspecialized for this newer use case.
% Equality saturation workloads exhibit distinct characteristics and
%   often require ad~hoc \egraph extensions to
%   incorporate transformations beyond purely syntactic rewrites.
一个 \egraph （e 图）可以有效地表示许多表达式上的同构关系。
虽然它最初是在 20 世纪 70 年代末为用于自动定理证明器而开发的，
  最近的一项技术被称为 \textit{等式饱和（equality saturation）}。
  重新利用了 \egraphs 来实现最先进的技术（SOTA），用于
  重写驱动的编译器优化和程序综合器（program synthesizers）。
然而，对于这种新的使用情况，\egraphs 仍然没有被专门化。
等式饱和的工作量表现出明显的特征，并且
  往往需要专门的 \egraph 扩展来纳入纯语法重写之外的转换。

% This work contributes two techniques that make
%   \egraphs fast and extensible, specializing them to equality saturation.
% A new amortized invariant restoration technique called \textit{rebuilding}
%   takes advantage of equality saturation's distinct workload,
%   providing asymptotic speedups over current techniques in practice.
% A general mechanism called \textit{\eclass analyses}
%   integrates domain-specific analyses into the \egraph,
%   reducing the need for ad hoc manipulation.
我们的工作提供了两项技术，使 \egraphs 快速和方便扩展，
  使其专门用于等式饱和。
一是新的摊销的不变性恢复技术，称为 \textit{重建（rebuilding）} 。
  利用了等式饱和的独特工作量。
  在实践中提供了比目前技术更多的渐进式加速（asymptotic speedups）。
二是一个名为 \textit{\eclass analyses} （e类分析）的通用机制，它
  将特定领域的分析整合到 \egraph 中，减少了临时操作的需要。         

% We implemented these techniques in
%   a new open-source library called \egg.
% Our case studies on
%   three previously published applications of equality saturation
%   highlight how \egg's performance and flexibility
%   enable state-of-the-art results across diverse domains.
我们将这些技术在一个新的开源库实现，叫做 \egg。
我们对以前发表的三个等式饱和的应用进行了案例研究，
  它突出了 \egg 的性能和灵活性，在不同的领域可达到最先进的效果。
